Majority of the code comes from: https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general <br>
Some inspiration for NN structure comes from: https://github.com/Unimax/alpha-zero-general-chess-and-battlesnake

## How to execute a run:
1) Define a configuration of your NN and AZ parameters in a config file (you can refer to the present config as a how-to)
2) Go in the main.py file, import the configuration file you want to use
3) run python main.py from the terminal
